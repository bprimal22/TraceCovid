# TraceCovid
Using IoT devices and an app utilizing Bluetooth of your phone, we will trace COVID-19 at UT Austin. 
We will have a heat map of COVID-19 at UT Austin which can be used to notify the users about their exposure to COVID-19. 
More importantly, it will provide UT Austin to target and sanitize areas within UT with high prevalence of COVID-19.  

The app will also be the first and the complete guide to UT Austin students this fall to get tested for COVID-19. 
This is our approach to get more users (especially tested for COVID-19) to be a part of our service.
